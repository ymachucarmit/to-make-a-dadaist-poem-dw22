    <h1>To Make a Dadaist Poem</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Take a newspaper.</li>
      <li>Take a pair of scissors.</li>
      <li>Choose an article as long as you are planning to make your poem.</li>
      <li>Cut out the article.</li>
      <li>
        Then cut out each of the words that make up this article and put them in
        a bag.
      </li>
      <li>Shake it gently.</li>
      <li>
        Then take out the scraps one after the other in the order in which they
        left the bag.
      </li>
      <li>Copy conscientiously.</li>
      <li>The poem will be like you.</li>
      <li>
        And here are you a writer, infinitely original and endowed with a
        sensibility that is charming though beyond the understanding of the
        vulgar.
      </li>

      const article = `The very fact Russian forces were willing to conduct a battle in and around a nuclear power plant was condemned by Western leaders. Speaking at a hastily convened meeting of the UN Security Council, US ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield described the fighting as "incredibly reckless and dangerous. And it threatened the safety of civilians across Russia, Ukraine and Europe". The situation brought into sharp focus the terrible risks attached to conducting a war around nuclear facilities. Had a reactor been hit and a Chernobyl-style meltdown occurred, the world would be in a very different situation right now. But for all the danger and drama attached to that all-too-real risk, it's not the only nuclear danger ahead.`;
